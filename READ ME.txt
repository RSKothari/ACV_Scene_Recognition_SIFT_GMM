Instructions:

Training
1. Run 'Reset_files.m' to reset all the data stored to null. It clears the SIFT vectors and the databases.
2. Run 'Training.m' to start training the database. Note: the code is self preserving, if you decide to stop trainig
and continue later, just stop training and run the file again, it will pick up from the last image you stopped at.

Testing
1. Run 'Testing1.m' to generate recognized scenes for the training dataset. Operation time: around 1.15 hours for 150 images
2. Run 'Train_network.m' to traing a neural network based on the training and testing database. Observe the confusion matrix.
Re-train if we get garbage answers. Best fitting can be observed with 5 hidden nodes.
